# Memory Match Game ðŸŽ®

This is a simple memory matching game I built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to flip cards and find matching emoji pairs. I added a move counter to track how many tries it takes, and a win screen that shows up once all matches are found. The layout is also responsive, so it works well on mobile devices.

- Lets you flip two cards at a time

## Why I built it

Iâ€™m currently preparing for campus placements and wanted to build a beginner-friendly project that shows my front-end and Flask skills. This helped me practice JavaScript logic, responsive design, and structuring a Flask app properly.
